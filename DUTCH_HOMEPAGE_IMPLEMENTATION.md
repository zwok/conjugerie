# Dutch Homepage Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a Dutch homepage for the La Conjugerie website, a French verbs learning tool, and the subsequent updates to match both homepages to the rest of the web application in structure and styling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added a New Route
Added a new route for the Dutch homepage at `/nl` in the `web.php` file:

```php
Route::get('/nl', function () {
    return view('welcome_nl');
})->name('welcome.nl');
```

### 2. Created a Dutch Homepage View
Created a new view file `welcome_nl.blade.php` in the `resources/views` directory, based on the existing `welcome.blade.php` file but with Dutch content explaining the purpose of the website.

Key changes in the Dutch homepage:
- Changed the HTML lang attribute to "nl"
- Translated navigation links to Dutch ("Inloggen" and "Registreren")
- Added a Dutch title "Welkom bij La Conjugerie"
- Added Dutch content explaining what the website is about:
  - A brief introduction to La Conjugerie as a French verbs learning tool
  - A list of features users can use on the website
  - A call-to-action button in Dutch ("Begin met oefenen")

### 3. Added Language Switching Links
- Added a "Nederlands" link on the English homepage that points to the Dutch homepage
- Added an "English" link on the Dutch homepage that points back to the English homepage

### 4. Updated Homepage Structure and Styling
Updated both the English and Dutch homepages to match the structure and styling of the rest of the web application:

- Changed the font from instrument-sans to figtree
- Updated the body class to use the same styling (antialiased, bg-gray-100)
- Implemented a consistent header structure with navigation links
- Created a main content area with a white background card
- Added a footer with copyright information
- Updated the styling of buttons to match the indigo color scheme
- Ensured consistent spacing and layout across all pages

## How to Access
- English homepage: `/` (root URL)
- Dutch homepage: `/nl`

## Future Improvements
Potential future improvements could include:
- Implementing a full localization system using Laravel's built-in localization features
- Adding more languages as needed
- Creating a language switcher dropdown if more languages are added
- Further refining the responsive design for various screen sizes
